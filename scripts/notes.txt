create_files function/ script

    should this be a function? better to have 1 large function or many small functions?

    currently creating the project folders here.. maybe move this elsewhere

    how to check if DCE_01 folder exists and then create new incremental folders
        - then save this folder as an object so that I can create new files in DCE_xx

   currently: 
    project path
    file with desired coordinate system
