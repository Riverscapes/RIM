## Riverscape Inundation Mapper inputs

The next step is to run the Project Builder script. This script is designed to take the inputs and organize them and create a folder structure as well as an XML file for the project. This script will create empty shapefils for your first Data Capture Event (DCE)

## Inputs
- **project_path** - The path to a folder where you want the project folder structure to be created
- **srs_template** - The path to a shapefile that contains the desired coordinate system and projection for your project shapefiles
- **DEM** - The path to the input DEM
- **site_name** The name of the project
- **huc8** - the 8 digit Hydrologic Unit Code
