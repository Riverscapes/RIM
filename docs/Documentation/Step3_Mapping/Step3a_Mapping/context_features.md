#### Valley bottom
##### Background
[Wheaton et al., 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281321324_Geomorphic_Mapping_and_Taxonomy_of_Fluvial_Landforms) defined the valley bottom as the active channel(s) and contemporary floodplain. The spatial extent of the valley bottom represents the area that could plausibly flood during the contemporary flow regime. The margins or lateral extent of the valley bottom will be a confining margin, which are hillslope, fans, or terraces ([Wheaton et al., 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281321324_Geomorphic_Mapping_and_Taxonomy_of_Fluvial_Landforms)).

##### Mapping
During Step 2 an empty valley bottom shapefile was created in the **02_Mapping/RS_01 folder** of your project folder and is called valley_bottom.shp
###### Useful resources and lines of evidence for identifying the valley bottom extent
When mapping the valley bottom it is beneficial to use all available lines of evidence including observations made in the field, a DEM, aerial photos, google earth, contour maps, hillshades, etc. The upstream and downstream edge of your valley bottom polygon will determine the longitudinal extent of you project area.
#### Valley bottom centerline
##### Mapping
During Step 2 an empty valley bottom centerline shapefile was created in the **02_Mapping/RS_01 folder** of your project folder and is called vb_centerline.shp

The valley bottom centerline can be manually digitized or created using the ArcGIS [Polygon to Centerline Tool](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=bc642731870740aabf48134f90aa6165)
