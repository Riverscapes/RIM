#### Valley bottom
##### Background
The valley bottom is defined as the channel(s) and contemporary floodplain. The spatial extent of the valley bottom represents the area that could plausibly flood during the contemporary flow regime. The margins or lateral extent of the valley bottom will be a confining margin. Confining margins are hillslope, fans, and terraces.
