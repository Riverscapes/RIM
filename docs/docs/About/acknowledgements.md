## RIM Development Team


RIM was primarily developed by Karen Barelt as part of her Masters Thesis in the ETAL Lab, with guidance from [Joe Wheaton]([https://joewheaton.org](https://www.riverscapes.net/users/5826874)) and [Philip Bailey](https://www.northarrowresearch.com/people). Karen now works for the USGS. For a complete list of developers and their contributions, see the [RIM Github repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RIM/graphs/contributors). [Chalese Hafen](https://www.riverscapes.net/users/6015113) was critical in helping with curation of the RIM project types and Jordan Gilbert helped get the releases packaged up. Thanks to Matt Reimer and Jordan Gilbert for getting the [RIM projects into the warehouse](/Examples/ExampleData).
