# Riverscape Inundation Mapper (RIM) tool

[![RIM_01](/img/RIM_01.png)](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8226/)

The **Riverscapes Inundation Mapper** Tool, or **RIM**, was developed as part of Karen Bartelt's Thesis ([Bartelt et al. 2021](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8226/)) to aid in the efficient mapping of structurally forced inundation patterns in beaver impacted riverscapes. RIM has since been published in Bartelt et al. ([2025](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pwat.0000428)) and the RIM mapping procedures and metrics have been incoprorated into various protocols (e.g. [LTPBR V2](https://qris.riverscapes.net/technical-reference/protocols/protocol-library/dce-protocols/ltpbr-dce-protocol/#resources)) inside Riverscapes Sudio - [QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net).



![Graphical Abstract](/img/GraphicalAbstract.png)


*The contrast in inundation patterns and types in undammed (top) and dammed (bottom) situations, across dramatically different riverscape settings (left to right) produces a strikingly similar impact. That is, at the same baseflows, inundation is increased from 2 to 7 fold with a greater diversity of flow types (i.e. more ponded and overflow areas instead of just free flowing).*
