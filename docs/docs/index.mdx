# Riverscape Inundation Mapper (RIM) tool

The **Riverscapes Inundation Mapper** Tool, or **RIM**, was developed as part of Karen Bartelt's Thesis ([Bartelt et al. 2021](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8226/)) to aid in the efficient mapping of structurally forced inundation patterns in beaver impacted riverscapes.

*The contrast in inundation patterns and types in undammed (top) and dammed (bottom) situations, across dramatically different riverscape settings (left to right) produces a strikingly similar impact. That is, at the same baseflows, inundation is increased from 2 to 7 fold with a greater diversity of flow types (i.e. more ponded and overflow areas instead of just free flowing).*

## A Riverscapes Consortium Tool

**RIM** [0.1.0](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RIM/releases/tag/v0.1.0) as published here, is a BETA [research-grade tool](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/discrimination.html#research-grade). It is a mix of Python and R with ArcPY dependencies. It has been successfully deployed by others, but is finicky to deploy.

Development of RIM has shifted from its own ArcToolbox into a Protocol implemented as part of data capture events in Riverscapes Studio for QGIS or [QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net/) thanks to support from the USFS and NOAA.

The types of beaver dam building activity impacting riverscapes that RIM was designed to capture and distill:
