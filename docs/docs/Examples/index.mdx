## Beaver Dam Building Opportunities
In Figure 2 and Appendix A of Bartelt ([2021](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8226)), 'Beaver Dam Building Opportunities' are differentiated into _classic_, _steep_ and _floodplain_.

## Schematics of Inundation Contrasted

[![RIM_03](/img/RIM_03.png)](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8226/)

In each of the 36 sites below, schematics of inundation within the valley bottom (white) are shown as pairs with the same site without beaver dam activity on top, and with beaver dam activity on the bottom. This is the primary mapping result of RIM (i.e. digitizing inundation extent). In each figure, the first column are sites within **classic** settings (i.e. < 6% slope and damming main channel), **steep** settings (>6% slope) and **floodplain** settings (dams primarily on floodplain and side channels).
