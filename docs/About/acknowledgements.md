## RIM Development Team

RIM was primarily developed by [Karen Barelt](http://etal.joewheaton.org/karen-bartelt.html) as part of her Masters Thesis int the [ETAL Lab](https://etal.joewheaton.org), with guidance from [Joe Wheaton](https://joewheaton.org) and [Philip Bailey](https://www.northarrowresearch.com/people).  Karen now works for the USGS. For a complete list of developers and their contributions, see the [RIM Github repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RIM/graphs/contributors). Chalese Hafen was critical in helping with curation of the RIM project types and Jordan Gilbert helped get the releases packaged up.
